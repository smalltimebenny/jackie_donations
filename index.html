        <p>From Facebook:</p>
        <p>Jackie lost everything in a fire yesterday morning (2/27/2023).</p> 
    <p>There was no insurance, so she literally has nothing. There’s going to be something set up for donations to try to help her get back on her feet. If you know her, she is an amazing person who always makes everybody laugh and smile and she definitely did not deserve to have this happen in her life. She needs smiles right now.</p> 
        <p>If anybody wants to pitch in anything to help her get her life back, please see below.</p> 
        <p>She doesn’t have a place to store things. At the moment, Visa Cards or Walmart cards would be good. She can replace what she needs as she needs it and eventually find storage. It can be picked up and delivered to her or sent to the PO Box below if you aren’t local and want to pitch in .</p>
